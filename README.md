# Gentleman Forester

Are you a small forest land owner?  Are you uncertain how to respond when someone asks “What are you going to do with your land”?  We are too.

Globally speaking, people have cleared a lot of forest, resulting in plummeting numbers of non-livestock land mammals, primarily due to loss of habitat.

Most of this loss is for industrial agriculture, and being less of a contributor to that is as ‘simple’ as eating less animal-based food.

Much of the rest of the loss comes from people wanting in a nice place in the woods.  This is where our path started.

As of March 2025, we're one year into our first land project and about to undertake a second.  Given the above, we’re actively contemplating what “a nice place in the woods” means to us.
