          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            I found the place on Redfin. In under a week I went from doing a
            drive-by of the property, to having it and septic inspected, to
            closing on October 24, 2025.
          </p>
          <p>
            DB was my broker, and as a thank-you, he did 2 trailers of dump
            runs. The first was taken the morning I met him there. He had 2 of
            his employees come to help load up the trailer, and it took no time
            grabbing stuff from the garage and ripping carpet out from the
            bedroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            It actually went a little faster than I would have chosen. I was
            inclined to sort through what might be worth keeping. In hindsight,
            I'm glad I didn't have that choice. The pile was disgusting, and it
            was great to get a big jump on clearing out what turned out to be a
            massive rat nest.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next two days I pulled debris from the garage and scraped the
            concrete floor of the compacted sludgy base of a mature rats nest. I
            uncovered rats both dead and alive, bird bones, and the like.
            Especially disgusting was a broken but live fridge that had to be
            defrosted then hauled off. I'd have to take fresh air breaks when my
            gag reflex started sending warning shots.
          </p>
          <p>
            Breaks consisted of pulling out incredible shoots of blackberry that
            dangled down through the grape vine gazebo, and ivy making its way
            into the backyard from beyond the fence. The landscaping was clearly
            at one point well maintained, and diverse, but now fallen into
            neglect. I didn't take ample photos of or comprehensively identify
            plants before leaves fell off for the winter, but I did note that
            there are many interesting specimens.
          </p>
          <p>
            I prioritized cleaning out the garage to take advantage of the
            second dump run ASAP, and try to stop the place from being a major
            vermin haven. I staged a trailer full in the driveway, then one
            morning it was magically gone when I got there...a real gift. Thanks
            again, DB.
          </p>
          <p>I did a run in the tiny truck with just the dead fridge and hazmat.</p>
          <p>
            After that, back to the home itself, the first priorities were
            actually olfactory: it had to stop smelling so foul ASAP. I sealed
            up rat ingress points, started drying out smelly stains on the
            subfloor so I could seal it up with paint, and tracked down other
            sources of stink.
          </p>
          <p>
            The kitchen sink's drainage was super clogged (several utensils had
            fallen in), and the faucet was impractical for the sink. I cleaned
            the drains out, replaced the drain cups, and the faucet.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were holes drilled along the deck-facing side of the gutter
            which acted like a sprinkler to pour water onto the carpeted deck.
            The gutter was integrated into the structure of the awning in such a
            way it's very difficult to clean out. This was one of the last
            things I did before leaving town for a couple of weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also left a 1.2A fan running, working on drying out the moist
            section of the living room subfloor.
