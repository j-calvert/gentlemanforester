          <h2>First Days</h2>
          <p>
            I found the place on Redfin. I went from drive-by, to inspections,
            to closing in under a week.
          </p>
          <p>
            My friend DB was my broker, and he did 2 dump runs with his trailer
            as a thank-you. The first was taken the morning I met him there to
            get my keys. He had 2 of his employees help load up the trailer, and
            it took no time to load the it with stuff from the garage and carpet
            from the bedroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            It actually went a little faster than I would have chosen...I was
            inclined to sort through what might be worth keeping. In hindsight,
            I'm glad I didn't have the choice. The pile was disgusting, and it
            was great to get a big jump on clearing out what turned out to be a
            massive rat nest.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next two days I continued pulling debris from the garage, and
            scraping the concrete floor of the compacted sludge at the bottom of
            the rats nest, uncovering rats both dead and alive, along with bird
            bones and the like. Especially disgusting was a broken but powered
            fridge that had to be defrosted then hauled off. I'd have to take
            fresh air breaks when my gag reflex started sending warning shots.
          </p>
          <p>
            Breaks consisted of pulling out shoots of blackberry that dangled
            down through a grape vine gazebo, and ivy making its way into the
            backyard from beyond the fence. The landscaping was at one point
            well maintained and diverse, but fallen into neglect. I didn't take
            ample photos or fully identify plants before their leaves fell off for the
            winter, but I did note several interesting looking ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            I prioritized cleaning out the garage to take advantage of the
            second dump run ASAP, and try to stop the place from being a major
            vermin haven. I staged a trailer load in the driveway, then one
            morning it was magically gone...a real gift.
          </p>
          <p>
            I did a final run in the tiny truck for just the dead fridge and some
            hazmat. After that, back to the home itself, my highest priorities
            were olfactory: I needed it to stop smelling foul ASAP. I sealed up
            rat ingress points, started drying out smelly stains on the subfloor
            so I could seal it up with special oil paint, and tracked down other
            sources of stink.
          </p>
          <p>
            The kitchen sink's drains were clogged with what turned out to be
            utensils that had fallen in the busted drain baskets, and the faucet
            was impractical for the sink's novel, dated design. I cleaned the
            drains out, and replaced the drain cups and faucet.

            I had to leave town for a couple of weeks. Having addressed all
            other sources of foul smell, I left a 1.2A fan running, drying out
            the moist section of the living room subfloor. This seemed harmless
            at the time.
