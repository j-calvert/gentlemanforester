          <h2>January, 2026</h2>
          <p>
            I found the land for sale about a year after I started on the
            Frankenberry land project. It was hilly and would be difficult to
            develop, but my experience with Frankenberry made me realize that I
            was primarily interested in the forestry aspects of land ownership.
          </p>
          <p>
            I took the Coached Planning course offered by
            <a href="https://forestry.wsu.edu/"
              >Washington State University Extension Forestry Program</a
            >
            for a second year, and wrote a land management plan. The land was
            already in pretty good shape, and executing on the plan has been a
            lot easier than Frankenberry.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked with the people at the King County Public Benefit Rating
            System (PBRS) department to refine the areas of forest management
            that qualify for tax incentives. There was a clerical discrepancy
            between that department's recording of the size of the land, and the
            county assessor's office, which I was able to help resolve.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a presence in the neighborhood established, I reached out to
            Chris and Lisa at
            <a href="https://www.forestgardenfarm.earth/">Forest Garden Farm</a>
            and started voulunteering there on a regular basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through some of the folks that work there, I was introduced to the
            couple that live adjacent to my land, Jim and Edna Dam, who have a
            labyrinth on their land. Now my days on island consist of working on
            the farm, then going to Jim and Edna's to work on, or just walk, the
            labyrinth with them.  They've composed a lovely overview of it, and agreed to
            let me host it here.
