        <h2>Our Moss Labyrinth</h2>
        <h4>October 30, 2024<br />Revised December 2025</h4>
        <p>
          Inspired by a talk by Betty Hawkins in 2006, we started a labyrinth
          built of moss-covered logs. Sited in a low, damp, slightly open area
          among tall cedars, big-leaf maples, large old alders, a huge hollow
          cedar snag, and several old-growth stumps, it seems to provide an
          ideal medium for the growth of a variety of lush, bright mosses. We
          built the labyrinth using the classic seven-ring Cretan pattern. An
          ancient design found in most cultures; it is sometimes dated back more
          than 4000 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea was simple, though the execution took a few years. All
          materials were found on our 10-acre (now 5 acre) property, and as
          storms bring down better specimens, we incorporate them into the
          labyrinth. We love to walk our labyrinth in all seasons and all kinds
          of weather, though it's really at its best in late winter when the
          moss is brightest. It's a celebration of moss, and it gives us a
          "destination" with which to encourage visitors to walk in the woods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The labyrinth has become a central feature of our property, drawing
          both family and friends to explore its winding paths. Its presence
          fosters a sense of tranquility and connection to nature, inviting
          reflection and quiet moments amid the vibrant greenery. Each visit
          reveals subtle changes, as new mosses take hold and the landscape
          shifts with the seasons.

          As you approach the labyrinth you will see an old growth stump with
          several young hemlocks growing out the top. This pattern of growth
          appears in several places. Unfortunately, trees that are supported by
          a fragile stump are doomed to fail when the stump rots away.

          Early in 2025 we had a huge Big Leaf Maple fall across the labyrinth,
          taking down another big leaf maple. Looking at the broken stump, it
          appears that the maple roots spread out five feet above the ground,
          and there is a lot of air beneath where the roots eventually reached
          the soil.

          Talk about better specimens of logs for marking the rings! We had 30
          inch diameter logs by the dozens, and smaller ones by the hundreds. We
          cut out some bowl blanks for an island woodworker’s use. But most of
          the big logs stayed very close to where they fell.

          Getting back to approaching the labyrinth, you will approach four
          mostly straight rows of logs forming a cross at the center of the
          labyrinth, and you will turn left at the cross into ring five of the
          labyrinth. You will quickly see that the paths differ from perfect
          curvature wherever there is a tree or stump in the way. Ring five goes
          almost back to the starting point where there is a switchback to ring
          six. Between rings five and six you will see the stump of the big leaf
          maple that collapsed in the 2024-5 winter.

          Half way back you will see a feature: There is a massive old growth
          stump that still bears the slots that once supported a springboard
          platform that loggers used to stand upon while sawing down a massive
          fir tree.

          Ring six continues back almost to the entry point, where there is a
          switchback to ring seven, which is the outer ring of the labyrinth. At
          about the midpoint of ring seven there is another feature, the burned
          out cedar snag.

          Ring seven continues back near the entry point where it switches back
          to ring four which touches the cross at the center of the labyrinth.
          Ring four takes you to a switchback to ring one where there is another
          feature: The resident Hobbit at center of labyrinth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hobbit lives in a hollow big leaf maple, which received a lot of
          damage from the falling maple in the winter ending in 2025.

          Ring one switches to ring two which switches to ring 3. Ring three
          leads to a dead end. From this point you can walk the entire labyrinth
          back to the entry or you can find a shortcut across the rings.
