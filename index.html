    <h1>Gentleman Forester</h1>
    <p>
        Are you a small forest land owner? Are you uncertain how to respond when someone asks “What are you going to do
        with your land”? We are too.</p>

    <p> Globally speaking, people have cleared a lot of forest, resulting in plummeting numbers of non-livestock land
        mammals, primarily due to loss of habitat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of this loss is for industrial agriculture, and being less of a contributor to that is as ‘simple’ as
        eating less animal-based food.
    </p>
    <p>
        Much of the rest of the loss comes from people wanting in a nice place in the woods. This is where our path
        started.
    </p>
    <p>
        As of March 2025, we're one year into our first land project and about to undertake a second. Given the above,
        we’re actively contemplating what “a nice place in the woods” means to us.</p>
