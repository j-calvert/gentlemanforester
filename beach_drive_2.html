            When I returned after leaving the 1.2A fan running for 2 weeks,
            everything seemed fine until I unplugged the fan. Clearly this
            outlet had started to fail. For whatever reason, I found another
            outlet and plugged the fan back in after cleaning the plug
            terminals, and plugged a space heater into the fan, which has it's
            own set of outlets. After a minute or so, I noticed some popping
            sounds coming from the first outlet, and then noticed smoke coming
            from it. I rushed to cut power at the breaker panel, and none too
            soon.

            >I pulled the outlet out, still warm to the touch, to assess the
            damage. I was aware of the aluminum wiring, but this drove home some
            of the inherent risk. Apparently, oxidation resulting over time from
            the reaction of aluminum wire with terminals that are not compatible
            with aluminum introduces resistance, causing arcing. It's a feedback
            loop that causes more oxidation, causing more resistance, causing
            more arcing. The outlet that I had switched to, and started drawing
            significantly more current from, was chained through the already
            malfunctioning outlet's oxidized terminals. Thankfully, the melting
            of insulation around the aluminum wiring only went back a few
            inches, and I would be able to cut back to good wire and
            re-terminate to a new outlet.

            But first, somewhat freaked out by this near disaster, I had a
            couple of electricians come by to get their opinion on remedy, along
            with some aspects of the electrical system that had been identified
            during my buyer's inspection. I put together a
            <a href="https://www.unlimitless.org/beach_drive_electric">
              standalone webpage </a
            >and provided a link to it when collecting proposals for site
            visits. My fear was they would be adamant that I rewire the place
            with copper. ($$$$). I paid one smaller outfit a couple hundred
            dollars for a visit, and had a rep from a large outfit come by free
            of charge. They were both well rated online, and both of the mind
            that there were no major risks, provided I replaced the outlets
            in the house with modern ones rated CO/ARL, suitable for aluminum
            wire, and coat the exposed wires with antioxidant paste. They also
            assured me that I could do the 50 amp socket installation for my new
            induction range myself (the place came with no range at all).

            /></span>

            While I waited for delivery of replacement outlets and switches, I
            painted the now dry but still piss-stinky subfloor with
            odor-neutralizing paint, and replaced the crappy busted front door
            with a salvaged french door from
            <a href="https://www.seconduse.com/">Second Use</a>. Then I took off
            for another couple of weeks, but instead of leaving anything
            running, I left a single piece of bait for rats (a nub of carrot),
            with a trail cam trained on it. I wanted to see if I'd managed to
            close off all the entry points for the rats. It seems I did! No
            visits while I was gone, whereas before I left, I had multiple
            visits nightly.
